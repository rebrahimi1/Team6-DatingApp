Rationale for story points forecast:

We have completed one sprint so far. Typically, we would take the average of the  story points completed in our sprints and use that as our sprint velocity. But, with only one sprint completed yet, we will have to use that sprint's story point completion to estimate what we should be able to complete for this sprint. However, we simply have less work to do this sprint. So we forecast 15 story points this sprint. We know this will not be accurate though, as some items from the first sprint carried over into the second, so they will count for this sprint, even though they were over 2 sprints. So the next velocity will be even more accurate so we can get the average over 2 sprints.

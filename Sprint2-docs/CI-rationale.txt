We decided to use Git actions for our CI. The rationale behind this decision was the fact that we were using Github as our repository, and this tool works well with Github.
With some node.js and customizing the main.yml, we were able to set up CI for our project. Please check our .github/workflows folder for the main.yml file. Also, in the Sprint2-docs folder is a screenshot of the CI in action!

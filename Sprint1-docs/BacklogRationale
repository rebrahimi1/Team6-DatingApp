Rationale for backlog order:

The backlog is in order based on the prioritization of the items to be worked on.

Items to the top of the backlog are to be worked on first, with lower priority items to the bottom. For example, since the app involves matching profiles, so customization is high priority in order to get the necessary data from users for more accurate matching.

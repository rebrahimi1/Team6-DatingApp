-> Impediment (For all the team members' tasks): 

 

(3) The team made sufficient improvements in terms of UI design and web app design layout. Most importantly, the chat functionality was successfully implemented as it was one of the project risks which demonstrates the good risk management of the team. However, there were more features to be added to chat component for advancing it but due to shortage of time and resources, the team decided to build the core functionality of chat as it was the main requirement.
